Creating game like Bubble Trouble

Background

This game is similar to the game "Bubble Trouble" that I used to play during childhood. You are in charage of a character who is stuck in a land of bubbles. The purpose of the game is to pop all of the bubbles before any of them hit your character. If a bubble hits you, then you lose a life. You pop the bubbles by shooting out a spike that will pop the bubble if it connects. The bubbles start off large and break into smaller bubbles when they are popped. Eventually, they reach the smallest size bubble and when you pop those, the bubble disappears and can no longer hurt you. Once you pop all the bubbles, you clear the level.

Functionality & MVPs

In Bubble Trouble Lite, users will be able to:

1. Move their character left and right along the bottom of the screen by using their arrow keys

2. Pop the bubbles by shooting out a spike

3. Clear the level by popping all of the bubbles

4. Collect coins that add to your total score

5. Advance from one level to the next by clearing the level of all the bubbles


In addition, this project will include:

1. Instructions
2. README
3. The ability to change the projectile that you shoot in order to make it easier to hit the bubbles
4. The ability to use a shield that will protect you from falling bubbles
